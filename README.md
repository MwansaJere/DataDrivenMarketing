Data analysis and machine learning techniques to produce informed data driven marketing strategies
Data-Driven Marketing Strategies 🚗📊
Project Description
This project leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to enhance self driving car's customer segmentation and marketing strategies. By analyzing demographic perceptions of self-driving cars, the project provides insights into customer attitudes and behaviors. Using K-means clustering, PCA, and sentiment analysis (NLP), we identify key customer segments and recommend actionable strategies to increase trust in Tesla's autonomous technology.



Features 🌟
K-means Clustering:
Identifies distinct customer segments based on demographic data and attitudes toward self-driving cars.
Optimal clusters determined using the elbow method.
Sentiment Analysis (NLP):
Analyzes text data to assess public sentiment toward autonomous vehicles.
Visualizes insights using word clouds and summary metrics.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Provides demographic and attitudinal insights through bar charts, count plots, and correlation matrices.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Reduces data dimensionality for visualizing clustering results.
Targeted Marketing Recommendations:
Actionable strategies for improving public trust and acceptance of Tesla's autonomous technology, tailored to identified customer segments.

Limitations and Challenges ⚠️
K-means Clustering:

Assumes spherical clusters and predefined cluster counts.
Sensitive to outliers and high-dimensional data.
Sentiment Analysis:

Struggles with ambiguous or context-dependent sentiments.
Affected by noisy text data and informal language.
Scalability:

Processing large datasets in real-time may require additional optimization.
